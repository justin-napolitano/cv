# Web Scraping Application

:::{topic} Introduction
The web scraping application is a general purpose python application that can be modified to scrape data from nearly any website.  

In its current iteration it works, but could be reorganized.  

It could also be modified to save data locally.  Currently, it downloads search criteria from a google sheet and uploads the modified data to a google sheet.
:::


## How to Improve

* Reorganize the program skeleton.
* Avoid universal variables.. You know this but had to stick with the design in order to meet deadlines
* Modify the config structure
* Remove the excess spaghetti code
