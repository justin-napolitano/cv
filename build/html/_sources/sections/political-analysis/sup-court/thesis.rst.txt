================================================================================================

Description
----------------------
* I wrote this paper as a senior thesis during my undergraduate degree.
* I have converted it into the base of an open source project that I would like to expand upon as time permits.  The link to that documentation is `Court-Behavior.io <https://court-behavior.io>`_
* I completed the statistical analysis in IBM's SPSS platform.  Unfortunately, I no longer have the source code that I wrote to perform the analysis.
* Please Review the Sphinx Documentation link below to review the work.  

Findings
----------
* Voting behavior aligns with political party.
* The corpus of Supreme Court Case law is often used to justify personal preferences of the justices.
