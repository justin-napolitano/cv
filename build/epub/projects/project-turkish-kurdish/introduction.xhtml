<div class="section" id="the-kurdish-issue">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3"><span class="section-number">1.1. </span>The Kurdish Issue</a></h2>
<p>The Kurdish issue has affected the Turkish state since the establishment of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in the late 1970’s. Fighting for autonomy, the PKK has been the source of violence in southeastern Turkey, as terroristic events have taken the lives of countless Turkish civilians. The PKK has committed a range of human rights violations, including the utilization of child soldiers and the establishment of a comprehensive human trafficking network. The victims of these actions are not exclusively Turkish; in addition to these crimes leaking into the neighboring Syria and Iraq, PKK criminal activity has stretched into Europe, including Romania and Italy. In short, the PKK’s actions have been broad and destructive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-turkish-issue">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4"><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>The Turkish Issue</a></h2>
<p>The Turkish state is not only a target, but also victim of the conflict. Despite being signatories to several human rights agreements – including the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights – Turkey has passed controversial government orders to restrict the basic rights of their Kurdish population. These include, but are not limited to, the manipulation of local elections, the implementation of state guards, and curfews in primarily Kurdish areas. As a consequence of the fighting between the two groups, human rights violations have been plentiful.  Innocent civilians of all ethnicities are the true victims.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="intent-of-research">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5"><span class="section-number">1.3. </span>Intent of Research</a></h2>
<p>The primary intent of our research is to provide evidence of the social impact of the ongoing Kurdish national movement.  A special emphasis is placed upon events relating to women and to children. Secondarily, we strive to capture the human rights abuses committed by all parties involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-data">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6"><span class="section-number">1.4. </span>The Data</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="scope">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7"><span class="section-number">1.4.1. </span>Scope</a></h3>
<p>The Turkish-Kurdish Database contains information on protests, riots, strikes, etc…in Turkey with regard to Kurdish national and political movements.  There is no one Kurdish political party, nor is there one military arm.  Thus, the objective of this dataset is to capture all events with respect to Kurdish action within the state of Turkey.</p>
<p>We do acknowledge that Kurdish factions within Turkey do no limit their range of action to the borders of the state.  Thus, international events that can be directly tied to a Kurdish organization based within the state of Turkey will also be captured in this dataset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coding-procedure">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8"><span class="section-number">1.4.2. </span>Coding Procedure</a></h3>
<p>Our coding procedure adopt the coding methodology of selected variables from the UCDP/Prio conflict dataset to maximize interoperability.   Each variable selected from the dataset are labeled with a UCDP tag.  As such, we have recoded a number of variables found in the UCDP/Prio Dataset to fit the methodology of our research.</p>
<p>We further enhance the dataset by adding a human rights component to record violations according to international treaties.  These are reflected by the Human_Rights_Category_Code and Human_Rights_Offense_Code variables.</p>
<p>As we chose to focus on women and children dichotomous variables have been added to designate whether any given event effects women and another to designate the same for children.</p>
<p>Variables have also been added to account for the deaths of women and of children.</p>
