# USSupremeCourtMetaDataGraph
Code that pulls the metadata of every US Supreme Court Case in the Library of Congress database into a Graph for analysis.  

I need to review the data.  I built it as a proof of concept for a research project that involved mining the US Supreme Court Corpus for specific data.  That Project is still a work in progress.  

The files within this project should enable researchers to mine all of the Metadata from the US Library of Congress API relating to US Supreme Court Jurisprudence.  The data can then be saved into a number of Graph DB backends with some additional work.

The additional work will be uploaded soon.  Currently working on a JanusGraph Stack implementation that can be run in a docker environment.
