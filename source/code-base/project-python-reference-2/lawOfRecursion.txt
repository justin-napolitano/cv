5.4. The Three Laws of Recursion
Like the robots of Asimov, all recursive algorithms must obey three important laws:

A recursive algorithm must have a base case.

A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.

A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.


All recursive algorithms must have a base case.

A recursive algorithm must change its state and make progress toward the base case.

A recursive algorithm must call itself (recursively).

Recursion can take the place of iteration in some cases.

Recursive algorithms often map very naturally to a formal expression of the problem you are trying to solve.

Recursion is not always the answer. Sometimes a recursive solution may be more computationally expensive than an alternative algorithm.
