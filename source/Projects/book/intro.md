# Supreme Court Voting Behavior

## Background
I started this project as an independent research effort during my senior year of university studies with guidance from Dr. Drew Lanier of the University of Central Florida.  

## Open Source Project
The literature review needs to be greatly expanded and improved upon.  

If you would like to contribute please message me (Justin Napolitano) at contribute@court-behavior.io

You may also clone this repository and work directly with the jupyter-books tools.  I will post the links to the installation and configuration pages soon.  

## Disclosure
I studied the Attitudinal Model as proposed by a number of theorists [^see-the-attitudinal-model].  Therefore, my work is heavily biased.
