# Experimental Design
 In this paper, the legal model is tested against the attitudinal model.   The intent is to best describe the process of Supreme Court decision making in relationship to Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission {cite}`masterpiececake`.  

## The Legal Model

The Legal Model consists of three major components: 

1. precedent [^need]
2. text (constitutional and statutory provisions) [^need] 
3. legislative intent. [^need]  

The initial analysis of Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission {cite}`masterpiececake` will consist of an argument dependent on all three. 


## The Attitudinal Model

The proposed attitudinal model will derive ideological values for the individual justices according to subject area [^reference].  This is accomplished by cross-referencing the current Supreme Court justicesâ€™ votes on the merits across time [^reference].  The first set of scores describe general voting behavior.  The next by first amendment cases.  Finally, by first amendment cases controlling for establishment [^const] and free exercise [^const] clause. and external situations [^reference].  When applying these to the facts of the case in Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. vs. Colorado Civil Rights Board (2018) it is expected that ideological scores will predict the outcome.
