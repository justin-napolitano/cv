As the court of last resort, The Supreme Court in no way must comply with the decisions of the lower courts, or obviously any superior court.  The result of which enables a level of discretion not apparent in the other branches of government, nor in the lower judiciary {cite}`songer1990overview`, {cite}`benesh2002us`.  In fact, non-compliant behavior among the lower courts is rare.  Even in the case of non-adherence to precedent by lower court judges, the Supreme Court often affirms the judgement as to reinforce its position at the apex of the judiciary {cite}`reddick2000norm`
