Political scientists further extended the ideas of the {ref}`political realists <realist_argument>`. 

Their arguments are founded upon the foundation of political science as argued by Somit and Tanenhaus ({cite}`somit1967development`, 177-178):

1. Political Science can ultimately become a science capable of prediction and explanation.
2. Political science should concern itself primarily, if not exclusively, with phenomena which can actually be observed. 
3. Data should be quantified and “findings” based upon quantifiable data.
4. Research should be theory oriented and theory directed
