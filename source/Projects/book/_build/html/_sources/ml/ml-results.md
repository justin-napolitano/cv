# Machine Learning Results

```{note}
I will be updating this section with the printout of the actual results soon.  

I have not run this program in  nearly a year, thus I need to configure my venv.

From memory, the ml analysis resulted in about 80 percent accurarcy in voting prediction accross the selected cases and time frames in only a few epochs.

I will verify these results soon.  

I am also aware that the model could be improved.
