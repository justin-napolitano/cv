    * I ensured that the data collection, aggregation, and integration procedures met standards defined in the literature to retain rigor for analysis.
    * I developed the training tools and manuals for research assitants.

:ref:`Database Designer <Database Schema>`
    * I designed a third normal database to maintain logical consistancy and variable independence of data points.
    * I refined the data to easily be recoded into a graph database.
    * I maintained the NoSQL database with Python scripts that automated the data integration procedures for a team of 5 data coders.

:ref:`Lead Analyst <data_page>`
    * I wrote Python Scripts to export data from the database into Pandas Dataframes in order to perform analysis.

.. _emotional_dec_making_overview: 

Emotional Decision Making 
----------------------------------

.. topic:: Emotions and Decision Making

    Dr. Tom Dolan focuses on how emotions/emotional intelligence dictate the behaviors of political agents.  My role was to code the sentiment of sentences collected during a parliamentary debate to determine the emotional states of parliamentarians prior to the invasion of Iraq.  

Data Coding:
    * I was intially hired to work as a data coder for the project that encoded the perceived emotional score of the transcripts of a Uk Parliamentarion debate regarding the prospect of invading Iraq.

Data Integration:
    * I proposed methods to integrate the data among three coders in a way that ensured reliable scoring. I integrated all of the data into a NoSql Database. I exported the data into excel files that were shared among the coders.
    
Data Verification:
    * I wrote python scripts that identified missing values and other patterns that required review. I maintained version history of the data to compare changes
