Real Estate Analysis Engine
===========================

Description
----------------------

* A graph of relationships between real estate agents and locations that can be used to identify regional clusters of top performing agents.  
* I designed this solution for a marketing firm that needed to identify valuable agents in order to sell marketing services.

How to Improve
-------------------

* Transforming this graph into a POLE style would improve analytic capability.
* I would like to add objects such homes, condos, or any other fungible asset sold by Real Estate Agents and events such as meetings, calls, and sales to the graph.

Janus Stack
---------------
* JanusGraph Server 
* Casandra Database backend
* Elastic Search Indexing 

JanusGraph API
---------------

* To deploy the graph I used the JanusGraph API tool that I had written in Python.
